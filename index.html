<h2>What to do if the applet is blocked/not working</h2>
<p>
 First of all, check to see if you have the right Java version. As of right now, that would be
 Java 7 update 67. You can check your Java version by looking
 <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">here</a><br>
 <br>
 If you have the right version then the applet is most likely blocked.
 To unblock the applet you will need to add this site to Java's
 exception site list in the Java control panel. Directions for how
 to do this can be found <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml">here</a>
 in the "Workaround" section<br>
 <br>
 I apologize for the inconvenience. When I wrote this applet I wasn't aware of the need to
 use code signing software to please Java security. The code signing software was too
 expensive for me to buy.
